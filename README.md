# Restaurant-Management-System-
This is a Restaurant Management System which has the following primary tasks:


# Project: Restaurant management system
## What structure and why did we choose this structure?
The idea I have is to create a menu option that’s controllable by admin and for customers.
We will be working with a dynamic data structure, as admin or the customer we will be adding to our menu or removing etc so
on so forth.
Therefore working with Splay trees and Linked Lists is the best option.
## What kind of operations are we using?
We will have operations to insert, sort, delete and one can imagine admin or customer would want to either add to the menu, possibly delete it.
Sort it to make sure a menu displayed doesn’t show the food in different orders than the admin input etc. I’ve used kind of like zig-zag operations for this
***
The system has will have two sections to it (or just 1 depending on if whether I can complete it in time)
In this Restaurant Management I would like to cover the following things. <br />
### (1) Admin <br />
● View Total Sales <br />
● Add new items to the menu <br />
● Delete items from the menu <br />
● Display the menu <br />
❖ Here we will give 5 options of a menu already, so the admin can add to it or remove from it etc <br />
❖ Name of food item : cost <br /> 
● Go back to the main menu: ie (options between Admin/Customer/Exit) <br />
### (2) Customer <br />
● Option for customer to place order <br />
❖ Now of course we cannot just expect the customer to know what to order without looking at the menu, <br />
therefore we will print the menu out for the user to pick from and place their order <br />
❖ The user may want to order multiple of the same thing, so we will give them that option by first asking what they want, then how many. <br />
● View ordered Items <br />
❖ On viewing we will show S.no of ordered item/Name/Amount ordered/total cost <br />
● Remove an item from their order if they wish to do so <br />
● Look at the final bill <br />
● Go back to the main menu: ie (options between Admin/Customer/Exit) <br />
### (3) Exit <br />
● Will just exit from the code. End program. <br />
                                                                               <br />
### Other relevant information <br />
The program will be interactive and will give a direct output every time. <br />
If the input displays no output, a valid message will be displayed in the output terminal. <br />
There will be (ideally) a constant loop so that the user can see the options every time - especially since i’ll just be working on vscode with the terminal so as the user I wouldn’t want to scroll all the way up etc, so I will just keep printing the main menu
and the subparts (like the bill cost, ordered items, changes to food menu and so on). <br />
How to run the Code <br />
We have the file which we have submitted, “Ashoka Dining System”. I just run that in VScode. Nothing extra per say has to be done. <br />
The section for user control has not been added otherwise that would have been a csv file. <br />
